angular-ripple
==============

![Click Gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsoncash/angular-ripple/gh-pages/click.gif)

A pure javascript (no polymer, no jQuery) AngularJS directive that adds a Google Material Design ripple effect when clicked or touched.

[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/) is cool, but sometimes you just want the ripple effect in your angular app without all the bloat. Thatâ€™s why we made this.

Ain't nobody f*ckin' with my [Clique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg)

# Demo

Here's a <a href="http://nelsoncash.github.io/angular-ripple">demo</a>

# Bower

  ```bash
  bower install --save angular-ripple
  ```


# Usage

Include the script in your HTML

  ```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/angular-ripple/angular-ripple.js"></script>
  ```

Then include `angularRipple` in your module dependencies

  ```js
  angular.module('yourApp', ['angularRipple']);
  ```

Then add the `angular-ripple` attribute to elements

  ```html
  <button angular-ripple>Ripple!</button>
  ```

Add some styles to the ripple (remember to include browser specific prefixes)

  ```css
  [angular-ripple] {
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
  .angular-ripple {
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    border-radius: 50%;
    transform: scale(0);
  }
  .angular-ripple.animate {
    animation: ripple 0.35s linear;
  }
  @keyframes ripple {
    100% {
      opacity: 0;
      transform: scale(2.5);
    }
  }
  ```
